# AO3Updater.koplugin
What This Plugin Does
- Checks an entire folder for the link provided in the epub(s) to see if the file's date, word count and chapters are different to the site's and downloads a new version to replace yours if so
What We'd Like It To Do
- Allow the choosing of specific files to check for updates when run
- Allow the entry of a work ID number to download a file from the site directly
- Some type of user authentication to update archive locked stories as necessary
